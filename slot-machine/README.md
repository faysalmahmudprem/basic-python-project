# Python Slot Machine 🎰

## Overview
This is a simple **Python slot machine game** built as part of my Python learning journey.  
The program simulates a casino slot machine where players can **place bets**, **spin the reels**, and **win or lose** based on matching symbols.

## ✨ Features
- Randomized symbol spins using Python’s `random` module 🎲  
- Betting system with balance tracking 💵  
- Payouts based on winning symbol combinations 🏆  
- Input validation for user-friendly gameplay ⚠️  
- Clean and fun command-line experience 🎮

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced
- Functions in Python  
- Lists and random selection  
- Loops (`while`)  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- User input handling and validation
