# Quiz Game ðŸŽ®  

## Overview  
This is a simple Python quiz game built as part of my Python learning journey.  
It asks multiple-choice questions, collects answers, and calculates a final score.  

The project is designed to practice:  
- Loops  
- Tuples and Lists  
- Conditional statements  
- User input and output
