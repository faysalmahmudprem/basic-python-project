# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²  

## Overview  
This is a simple Python number guessing game built as part of my Python learning journey.  
The computer randomly selects a number, and the player must guess it within a given range. Player can try unlimited time.

The project is designed to practice:  
- Loops  
- Random number generation  
- Conditional statements  
- User input and validation

## Future Improvements

1. Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
2. Track high scores
3. Add a limited number of attempts
4. Create a GUI version using Tkinter
